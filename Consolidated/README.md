This folder contains consolidated [Eagle](https://github.com/eez-open/psu-hw/tree/master/Consolidated/Eagle%20files) and [Gerber](https://github.com/eez-open/psu-hw/tree/master/Consolidated/Gerber%20files%20%28panel%29) files of all required EEZ PSU modules:
 * Power module **r5B13** (two per unit)
 * Auxiliary power supply **r5B13**
 * Arduino shield **r5B12** (digital control)

Centroid files was generated using Eagle's *mount-marks-smd.ulp* script.

All components are renumbered that single BOM can be used. PCB panel is created with four boards to decrease setup fee of PCB manufacturing and assembling.
